                        <p>Hi, I'm Tyler!</p>
                        <p>
                           I've been a software developer for over 5 years, and I specialize in web and application development. I enjoy creating efficient and user-friendly solutions to complex problems, and am
                           always eager to learn new technologies and explore different areas of the field. Outside of coding, I spend most of my time relaxing and playing video games. 
                           In particular I have a knack for old Nintendo games and systems, and have been an avid PC gamer since I was a kid. It's the main way that I socialize, connect
                           with others, and meet new people to work or hangout with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to get in touch with me to talk about software development,
                            or if you're just generally interested in what I do, you can contact me using any of the contact information I have listed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thanks for stopping by!

                            <h3>NaviAI | <em>Python, Django, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, AWS, GPT-4o</em></h3>
                            <h4>Senior Capstone Project, University of Utah, built in Spring 2025</h4>
                            <p>
                                NaviAI is a Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) web application made with the express purpose of aiding newer players with learning how to play the game for the first time. 
                                The application utilizes the powerful language model API, GPT-4o, to analyze information about the game and user input to provide advice to players on how to proceed in the game. 
                                The goal of the application is to provide new players a way to help them make D&D less daunting to approach, and to provide experienced players with a powerful resource to support 
                                and enhance their D&D experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>My roles in the project consisted of the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Supervised a team of 4 software developers by efficiently managing project timelines and development tasks using agile methodologies and project management tools.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Led the development of a Django-based web application integrating GPT-4o to assist players with Dungeons & Dragons gameplay, and optimized a PostgreSQL database to manage game-related data efficiently.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Spearheaded the development of a functional chat between users using web sockets, and the development of a user-friendly UI/UX design to provide real-time, context-aware responses from the AI, as well as the ability to interact and play D&D with other players.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                This project was designed by my senior capstone team in Fall 2024, and we developed the project over the course of Spring 2025.
